###### 1. Write the `correct answer` from the following options and give an explanation (2-5 lines).

```javascript
let greeting;
greetign = {};
console.log(greetign);
```

- A: `{}`
- B: `ReferenceError: greetign is not defined`
- C: `undefined`

<details><summary><b>Answer</b></summary>
<p>

#### Answer: B: `ReferenceError: greetign is not defined` 

<i>In the code provided, there is a typographical error. Instead of let greeting, it says let greetign, which is a misspelling. JavaScript is case-sensitive, so greetign is treated as a different variable from greeting. As a result, when you try to log greetign, it will throw a ReferenceError because greetign is not defined.</i>

###### 2. Write the `correct answer` from the following options and give an explanation (2-5 lines).

```javascript
function sum(a, b) {
  return a + b;
}

sum(1, "2");
```

- A: `NaN`
- B: `TypeError`
- C: `"12"`
- D: `3`

<details><summary><b>Answer</b></summary>

#### Answer: C: "12"

<i>In JavaScript, when you use the + operator with one or both operands as strings, it performs string concatenation instead of numerical addition. In this case, 1 is a number, and "2" is a string. When you add them together, JavaScript converts the number 1 to a string and concatenates it with "2", resulting in the string "12".</i>

###### 3. Write the `correct answer` from the following options and give an explanation (2-5 lines).

```javascript
const food = ["🍕", "🍫", "🥑", "🍔"];
const info = { favoriteFood: food[0] };

info.favoriteFood = "🍝";

console.log(food);
```

- A: `['🍕', '🍫', '🥑', '🍔']`
- B: `['🍝', '🍫', '🥑', '🍔']`
- C: `['🍝', '🍕', '🍫', '🥑', '🍔']`
- D: `ReferenceError`

<details><summary><b>Answer</b></summary>
<p>

#### Answer: A: ['🍕', '🍫', '🥑', '🍔']

<i>In this code, we create an array food containing emoji elements, and then we create an object info with a property favoriteFood that initially references the first element of the food array. Later, we change the value of info.favoriteFood to "🍝", but this change doesn't affect the food array. So, when we log the food array, it remains unchanged, and the output is ['🍕', '🍫', '🥑', '🍔'].</i>

###### 4. Write the `correct answer` from the following options and give an explanation (2-5 lines).

```javascript
function sayHi(name) {
  return `Hi there, ${name}`;
}

console.log(sayHi());
```

- A: `Hi there,`
- B: `Hi there, undefined`
- C: `Hi there, null`
- D: `ReferenceError`

<details><summary><b>Answer</b></summary>
<p>

#### Answer: B: Hi there, undefined

<i>The sayHi function expects a name parameter, but when it is called without any arguments, name inside the function becomes undefined. The function still executes, and the string template includes Hi there, followed by the undefined value, resulting in Hi there, undefined when logged.

###### 5. Write the `correct answer` from the following options and give an explanation (2-5 lines).

```javascript
let count = 0;
const nums = [0, 1, 2, 3];

nums.forEach((num) => {
  if (num) count += 1;
});

console.log(count);
```

- A: 1
- B: 2
- C: 3
- D: 4

<details><summary><b>Answer</b></summary>
<p>

#### Answer: C: 3

<i>In this code, the forEach method iterates through the elements of the nums array. The callback function checks if each num is truthy (i.e., not equal to 0). For elements 1, 2, and 3, the condition is true, and count is incremented by 1 for each of them. So, after iterating through the entire array, count becomes 3, and that is what is logged to the console.</i>
